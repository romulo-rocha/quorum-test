# Quorum test setup
The following script was coded with TypeScript, which is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript. The idea is to provide a code that is easy to read and an architechture that is scalable.

# Setup
To run the script, you must have Node installed on your computer. The version 16.14.0 of Node was used during the coding of the script, but you should be able to run it with older versions without a problem.

Run the command `npm install` into the main folder of the repository. Once the dependencies are successfuly installed (including development dependencies), you are ready to run the script to generate the requested CSV files.

Run the command `npm start` and wait until the process is finished. Check the console to see the progress. The CSV files will be generated into the `./output` folder.
